# Website Developement 

## Discription
I worked in a team of 3 developers and 3 designers to create an improved website for a local Salt Lake City business called Empire Body Waxing. I was a part of the developer side and mainly focused on the Front-end. As a whole team we had bi-weekly meetings with the owner of the business to understand her vision and goals for the improved website. The designers created a prototype that we then turned into a functional site for an overall more intuitive user experience. 

## Features

- Takes users to the sceduale appointment page
- Improved the acessibilty by adding bigger buttons and creating an aesthetic design
- Did 2 rounds of user testing, survarying cutomers 

## Tools
Used Django, HTML and CSS

## Relationship to CS and BCIS Program Goals
This class project fit great into the learning goals of the BCIS program. I got experience planing, designing, testing, and implementing a  software project as part of a group. By doing customer research and working with a real buisness, it gave good insights to applying business aspects with computer science principles. We developed a course of action and crafted solution strategies to help solve a business problem.
